-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Briefly, HepaRG and RPTEC/TERT1 cells were exposed to 5 test substances (PFOS, perfluorooctanesulfonic acid; PFOA, perfluorooctanoic acid; AB1, aflatoxin B1; Las, lasiocarpine; CdCl2, cadmium chloride) and cell viability (WST1 and neutral red uptake assay after 72 h), mRNA expression (PCR profiler arrays after 36 h), and abundance of protein or protein modifications (multiplexed microsphere-based sandwich immunoassay after 36 and 72 h) were analyzed.
This repository contains the obtained data and R files for data analysis and evaluation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.1 Cell viability testing
RPTEC_NRU_72h and RPTEC_WST1_72h contain test over control (T_C) and standard deviation (SD) data for all substances and concentrations. These files have to be imported and used in Cell_viability.R

Methods used for acquiring data: WST-1 and neutral red uptake assay (NRU) with an infinite M200 PRO plate reader (tecan, Maennedorf, Switzerland).
----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.2 Changes in gene transcription Levels
HepaRG_IPA_Upload and RPTEC_IPA_Upload contain data generated by the geneglobe web portal (https://geneglobe.qiagen.com/de/analyze) from Ct values.

HepaRG_Genes_Molecular_toxicology_Pathway_Finder and RPTEC_Array_GeneList include the genes that are on the arrays in the order of appearance.

HepaRG_genes_per_effect_MolToxPathFinder and RPTE_genes_per_effect_nephrotoxicity contain lists of genes assorted to the effects based on lists provided by the supplier.

HepaRG/RPTEC_Array_repX_data contain Ct vales for all substances per replicates used for supplementary figures.

Array.R is used to evaluate the array data and generate figures 2 and 3. Code to calculate percentage of differentially expressed genes and FDR correction is included.

DEG.R is used to determine differentially expressed genes and figure 1.

Methods used for acquiring data: RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Arrays "Human Molecular Toxicology Pathway Finder" (HepaRG) and "Nephrotoxicity" (RPTEC/TERT1) (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands) with an ABI 7900HT Fast RealTime PCR system intstument and Sequence Detection Systems (SDS) Software (version 2.4.1).

----------------------------------------------------------------------
3.3 IPA
The folders HepaRG, RPTEC, and combined contain IPA export files showing categories, deseases or functions annotations, p-values and number of molecules per substance. fold regulation threshold in IPA was set to -1.5 and 1.5 and p-values threshold to 0.05.
IPA.R code for importing exported IPA results, filtering and generating an overview of the 10 most frequently resulting categories.

IPA version 111725566 was used.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
3.4 Effects on marker proteins
HepaRG/RPTEC_Protein contain multiplex microsphere-based sandwich immunoassay readings for all samples and sample information.
Protein.R is used to analyse the data files and generate Heatmaps and supplementary boxplots.

Samples were analyzed by Signatope GmbH, Tübingen, Germany).
